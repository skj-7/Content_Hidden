## Introduction:
Our project envisages to solve the problem faced by small scale sellers and MSMEs selling their product online. These sellers neither have the resources nor the know-how to predict prices of products they are selling.
This leads to serious disadvantage by making their products less competitive. 

So in this project we aim to solve this problem and provide them with a price forecast of their products. So that they too can plan ahead about their business. 

This will improve the business of small scale sellers and MSME which in turn will help the local economy  and bring prosperity.
